  bio: As a Software Engineering major, graduated from North American University, I'm fascinated by the invisible power that computer science has. Currently, I'm researching about Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and always curious to figure out that how nice is to combine Computer Science and NeuroScience together.
        I've taken many computer classes so the knowledge I got from those classes I would love to implement that knowledge to make this world a better place.
